# Multiprocess SORT

This project was first developed as final assignment for the "Artificial Intelligence Laboratory" course at Sapienza University of Rome, then extended as work for my bachelor thesis.

## Overview

This project implements a multiprocess version of the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm using YOLOv8n as the object detection model. The implementation is optimized for real-time applications and is trained/evaluated on the 2D MOT15 dataset.

The multiprocess parallelization strategy separates detections task into concurrent processes, allowing for optimal resource utilization and higher frame rates in real-time applications.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Pyhton 3.8 or higher
- pip (Pyhton package manager)
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattiaplaci/multiprocess-sort.git
cd multiprocess-sort
```
### 2. Install Python Dependencies
It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Download the 2D MOT15 Dataset
```bash
# Create data directory
mkdir -p data

# Download MOT15 dataset
wget https://motchallenge.net/data/MOT15.zip -P data/

# Extract the dataset
unzip data/MOT15.zip -d data/

# The directory structure should look like:
# data/train/
# data/test/
```
If the direct download doesn't work, manually download from [MOTChallenge](https://motchallenge.net/data/MOT15/) and extract to the data directory.

### 4. YOLOv8n Model Weights
The model will be automatically downloaded on first run if not present.

## Usage

### Basic execution

```bash
# Run with default parameters
python src/main.py

# Run with real-time display
python src/main.py --display
```
### Other command line arguments
- ``` --save_output ``` Save algorithm results to file
- ``` --num_producers ``` Choose number of concurrent processes
- ``` --max_age ``` Maximum number of frames to keep alive a track without associated detections
- ``` --min_hits ``` Minimum number of associated detections before track is initialised
- ``` --iou_threshold ``` Intersection Over Union threshold for association
